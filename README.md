Hello,

I'm Cleber Zumba.

I am currently a Senior Data Engineer. I build ETL pipelines that produce modeling datasets for Data Science. Uses Python, Scala, Java, SQL to build ETL, orchestrations, integrations. In parallel, Iâ€™m actively studying mathematics, applied statistics, and core concepts in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I continuously apply concepts of Calculus, Mathematical Physics, and Data Engineering to build scalable pipelines, optimize distributed processing, and perform large-scale scientific computing and data analysis.
